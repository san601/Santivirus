# Santivirus
An AV that uses signature-based method with Boyer-Moore algorithm to scan for malware.

This application is a project for the "data structures and algorithms" course that applies Boyer-Moore algorithm. No real data was used in the process and the efficiency is nowhere near any real AV.

If you still want to run the project and see if you can improve anything, or just curious about it, then install all required library 
```pip install -r requirements.txt``` and run ```santivirus.exe```
